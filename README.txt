Message from the creater (2021):
Hi, I am a student currently in my 2nd semester doing Bachelor of Computer Science from FAST-NUCES, Pakistan.
As many students face issues doing complicated projects, I publically uploaded this project so others can view my code and seek help from it.
The code is very well commented so by going through it, you can easily get an idea of how any 2D game should be implemented and coded using C++.
Good luck in doing whatever you are doing currently.
Thank you! :)
